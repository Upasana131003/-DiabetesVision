# DiabetesVision: Detecting Eye Complications with AI

This project presents a deep learning-based system for classifying common eye conditions using retinal fundus images. The goal is to assist medical professionals in early diagnosis by providing accurate predictions along with explainable visual outputs through Grad-CAM.

## Project Objectives

- Classify retinal images into one of four categories:
  - Normal
  - Diabetic Retinopathy
  - Cataract
  - Glaucoma
- Use EfficientNetB0 for optimized and accurate image classification.
- Apply Grad-CAM to highlight regions influencing the model's decisions.
- Display prediction confidence scores and simple risk level insights.
